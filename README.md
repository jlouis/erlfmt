erlfmt
=====

Format Erlang Terms nicely with pretty-printing.

* Make swift work of log lines generated by e.g., Lager/Syslog/Kibana
  where the log line is written as a one-line entry.
* Handle error messages formatted incorrectly easily.
* tidy up sections of a `sys.config`

Usage
-----

This script can be used to format Erlang terms. It is especially
useful when you have an erlang term you got in one line and want it
indented in a readable fashion.

    $ erlfmt x.term

It will print the resulting term to stdout.

Build
-----

    $ rebar3 escriptize
